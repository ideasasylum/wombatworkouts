# Raw Idea

Redesign the application UI to have a minimalist, notepad-like aesthetic. The design should prioritize simplicity with:
- Minimal color palette
- Minimal text/words
- Icons prioritized over text labels where possible
- Clean, simple notepad-inspired styling
- Development approach: Desktop/tablet version first, then mobile version

This is a comprehensive UI overhaul that will affect styling across the entire application, transforming it from the current design to a more stripped-back, analog-inspired interface.
